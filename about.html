    <h2 class="about">Hi.</h2>

    <p>Thanks for stopping by. I'm glad you're here!</p>

    <p>I spend my days fixing healthcare at <a href="https://www.wellmatchhealth.com/">WellMatch Health</a>.
    When I'm not doing that, I'm probably working on any of a dozen side projects I always have going.</p>

    <p>I care a lot about pair programming, effective communication, and vulnerability as strength. I'm primarily
    a Rubyist, though I find myself writing more Javascript every day.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to get in touch, you can find me <a href="http://twitter.com/nmeans">on Twitter</a> or send me <a href="mailto:&#110;&#109;&#101;&#097;&#110;&#115;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">an email</a>. 
    You'll also find me most Tuesdays at <a href="http://twitter.com/cafebedouins">Cafe Bedouins</a>, so say hello.</p>

    <p>Cheers.</p>
