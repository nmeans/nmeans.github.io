title: Nobody Cares How It Works
category: posts

Two years ago, I was happily posting links and pictures on Tumblr at waxcathartic.org.  After running across a link to Peter Rojas's blog ([peter.roj.as](http://peter.roj.as/)), I decided that I, too, needed my very own American Samoan domain name. The $50 per year that vanity cost me made me want to take myself and my blogging more seriously, I suppose, and so I decided that I needed a fresh design and custom blog software.

I mean, what good is it being a software developer if your own site doesn't even run on something you created? Right?

<strike>Two</strike> Nearly three years of silence and several false starts would beg to disagree. 

Here's the thing: nobody cares what software runs your blog. Especially when you give them the answer to a question they've been researching for a few hours. 

When you know how to hack code, it's easy to wrap yourself up in a tiny case of "Not Invented Here" when it comes to your blog. Something about the way programmers approach the world means that we always think we could build it better.

Blogging is not about starting, though. It's easy to start. 3 unfinished blogging 'platforms' in my project directory and 10 unfinished drafts in Tumbler prove that. Blogging is about finishing. Finishing actual bits of wordcraft and putting them out there.

You likely can build something that fits you better, but do you really need to? The longer you spend building and maintaining your blog software, the less time you can spend actually, you know, blogging.

So, my resolution for the next year is to quit worrying if my design is perfect, if my software is custom, or if my article is sufficiently eloquent, and build the discipline to finish something once a week.
